# React Hook 18 Boilerplate 🚀

Hi everyone this is my boilerplate/architecture project for react hook 18, i use pre-define template to speed up development process, this boilerplate has featured many things that i believe this is has best practice in react, and also this template has no vulnerability issue and also this template has build from scratch, that only install package that i really need.

Also i make my own babel, jest and webpack configuration from scratch so its easy to improve in future if we want to update/upgrade, super high performance and high scalability because its ready to use for micro-frontend services, because all of the settings from development and build settings has on my own hand. easy to tweaks for me and easy for maintenance.
